# Instagram_caption_analysis
The challenge is to explore a set of real data that was obtained from 2016 to 2018. In more detail, ~ 9,000 messages from Instagram , which correspond to the posts of a selected panel of fashion influencers and where an algorithm has detected high heel ankle boots. Here is a summary presentation of the different fields: - an author ID identifying uniquely each poster ('authorid') - the timestamp of the post date ('ts', corresponding to dates from 2016 to late 2018) - the post textual content ('content') - the number of followers of the Instagram user ('followed') - the number of people that the Instagram user is following ('follows') - the number of 'likes' that this post got - when the user provided GPS locations, the fields 'country', 'continent' and 'city' exist and are filled with the relevant info - 'content_ *' and 'media' contain the predicted labels and scores of the visual recognition from the deep nets .
